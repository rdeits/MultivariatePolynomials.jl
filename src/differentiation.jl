"""
    differentiate(p::AbstractPolynomialLike, v::AbstractVariable, deg::Int=1)

Differentiate `deg` times the polynomial `p` by the variable `v`.

To differentiate by multiple variables or with multiple degrees simultaneously, you can simply use Julia's built-in function broadcasting:

### Examples

```julia
p = 3x^2*y + x + 2y + 1
differentiate(p, x) # should return 6xy + 1

# Using the `.()` notation for broadcast:
differentiate.(p, (x, y)) # should return (6xy+1, 3x^2+1)
differentiate.(p, [x, y], 2) # should return [6y, 0]
differentiate.(p, [x, y], (1:2)') # should return: [6xy+1 6y; 3x^2+1 0]
```
